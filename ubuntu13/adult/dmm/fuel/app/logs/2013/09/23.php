ERROR - 2013-09-23 08:12:18 --> Error - date_default_timezone_get(): It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected 'Asia/Tokyo' for 'JST/9.0/no DST' instead in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/ubuntu13/adult/dmm/fuel/core/classes/fuel.php on line 157
